# Digital-clock
A hardware design project implementing a digital clock with support for 12h/24h format with set time and reset time features, a configurable alarm system, and a stopwatch. The design is modular (separate files for clock, alarm, stopwatch), and includes a testbench (tb.sv) for simulation and verification.
